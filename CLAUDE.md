## Database Models

| Model | Key fields |
|-------|-----------|
| `Organization` | name, slug, billingEmail, industry, employeeCount, plan, department[] |
| `User` | organizationId, email, passwordHash, role, department, twoFactorEnabled |
| `SurveyTemplate` | organizationId, title, moduleType, **intakeType** ('survey'\|'interview'\|'assessment'), questions[], isActive |
| `SurveyResponse` | organizationId, templateId, respondentId?, coachId?, **sessionFormat**, **targetName**, submissionToken (unique), isAnonymous |
| `ConflictAnalysis` | organizationId, riskScore, riskLevel, conflictTypes[], aiNarrative, managerScript, **parentId?**, **focusConflictType?**, escalationRequested |
| `Plan` | key (unique), name, priceMonthly (cents), maxUsers, features[], isActive |
| `Invoice` | organizationId, amount, status, planKey |

---

## Multi-Tenancy Rules

**Never skip these:**
- Every DB query must include `organizationId` — the `tenantFilterPlugin` logs a warning if missing
- `Plans` are global (no `organizationId`) — skip `tenantResolver` on those routes
- `SurveyTemplate` uses `setOptions({ bypassTenantCheck: true })` when `isGlobal: true`
- Min group size = **5** responses before aggregation is exposed

---

## Roles & Access

```
system_admin   — cross-org system administration only (separate shell at /system-admin)
admin          — full org access
hr_manager     — all operational modules, no billing/org settings
manager        — read access to conflict/neuro-inclusion analytics, can escalate
coach          — conduct interviews, view intake templates (read-only), succession/IDP
coachee        — take surveys, view own IDP
```

Role-guard pattern: `canActivate: [roleGuard([...ROLE_CONST])]` in `app.routes.ts`.
Nav items use `roles?: AppRole[]` — undefined means visible to all authenticated users.

---

## Intake Types (SurveyTemplate.intakeType)

- `survey` — self-service, completed anonymously by respondents via public link
- `interview` — coach-led, conducted via `/coach/interview` on behalf of a coachee
- `assessment` — coach-led assessment, same flow as interview

Coach interview flow: template → setup (format: individual/team/group + target name + optional coachee) → questions → submit.
`POST /api/surveys/respond` accepts `coacheeId`, `sessionFormat`, `targetName` for coach-led sessions.

---

## AI Service (`backend/src/services/ai.service.ts`)

- `callClaude(prompt, systemPrompt?, maxTokens?)` — 3-retry with exponential backoff
- `buildConflictAnalysisPrompt()` — aggregated survey → conflict risk JSON
- `buildConflictSubAnalysisPrompt()` — focused deep-dive per conflict type
- `buildNeuroinclustionGapPrompt()` — neuroinclusion maturity gap analysis
- `buildIDPPrompt()` — GROW model IDP generation

All prompts instruct Claude to respond with **only valid JSON** — no markdown fences.
Parse pattern: strip fences, slice `{...}`, `JSON.parse`, fallback on error.

---

## Frontend Conventions

- **Signals everywhere**: `signal()`, `computed()`, `update()` — avoid `BehaviorSubject`
- **Standalone components only** — no NgModules
- **`ApiService`** for all HTTP: `api.get<T>('/path')`, `api.post<T>('/path', body)`
- **`AuthService.scheduleTokenRefresh()`** — called on login and app-shell init; silently refreshes JWT 60s before expiry
- Inactivity logout: 30 min, with 2 min warning via `inactivityWarning` signal
- Brand colors defined in `_variables.scss`: Navy `#1B2A47`, Blue `#3A9FD6`, Green `#27C4A0`
- Angular Material theme: `styles.scss`
- Component styles use SCSS nesting — keep styles co-located in the component file

---

## Backend Conventions

- All routes: `router.use(authenticateToken, tenantResolver)` — except Plans (global) and auth endpoints
- `requireRole(...roles)` middleware for role-gating individual routes
- `AuthRequest` extends `Request` with `user: { userId, organizationId, role }`
- Error handling: throw, let `errorHandler` middleware catch — don't swallow errors with empty catch blocks
- Seed scripts run via `ts-node` locally; on server compile first (`npm run build`) and run `node dist/scripts/seed-*.js`

---

## API Routes Summary

```
/api/auth/*              — login, register, refresh, 2FA
/api/users/*             — CRUD (admin/hr), /me (self), /coachees (coach+)
/api/surveys/*           — templates CRUD, /respond, /check/:id, /responses/:id
/api/conflict/*          — /analyze, /analyses, /analyses/:id/sub-analyses, /escalate/:id
/api/neuroinclusion/*    — assessment CRUD + AI gap analysis
/api/succession/*        — IDP CRUD + AI generation
/api/org-chart/*         — org chart data
/api/dashboard/*         — summary stats
/api/hub/*               — messaging
/api/billing/*           — Stripe integration (org-level)

/api/system-admin/*      — cross-org admin
/api/system-admin/billing/* — invoice generation
```

---

## Seeding (local dev / first deploy)

```bash
npm run seed:admin    # creates system_admin + first org + admin user
npm run seed:surveys  # seeds default intake templates
npm run seed:plans    # seeds 12 subscription plans (drops existing)
```

On server (compiled JS only — no ts-node):
```bash
node dist/scripts/seed-plans.js
```

---

## Known Gotchas

- `${{ }}` in Angular templates is parsed as a JS template literal — use `{{ formatAmount(val) }}` helper methods instead of inline expressions starting with `$`
- Angular build warns on unnecessary `??` when the type doesn't include `null | undefined` — safe to ignore but clean up when convenient
- `scroll` events inside MatDialog overlays don't bubble to `document` — activity tracking uses `mousemove`/`keydown`/`mousedown`/`touchstart` which work fine
- The `tenantFilterPlugin` only warns on missing `organizationId` in development — don't rely on it as a hard guard in production
- `SurveyResponse.submissionToken` has a unique DB index — duplicate submissions fail at DB level; always handle the 409 response in the frontend

## Booking Module — Google Calendar Sync Model

Our sync model mirrors Calendly's verified behavior:

| Direction | Trigger | Effect | Implemented |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| GCal → System | Coach deletes/declines event | Booking cancelled, client emailed | ✓ (gated by `BOOKING_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED`) |
| GCal → System | Coach reschedules event | Booking time updated, client emailed | ✓ (same gate) |
| GCal → System | Client deletes event | No effect (we watch coach calendar only) | ✓ by design |
| GCal → System | FREE event added | No effect (freebusy API excludes FREE) | ✓ |
| System → GCal | Booking created | GCal event created in `targetCalendarId` | ✓ |
| System → GCal | Booking cancelled | GCal event deleted (graceful on 404/410) | ✓ |
| System → GCal | Booking rescheduled by admin | GCal event patched with new times | ✓ |

Key implementation notes:
- `targetCalendarId` is always included in the freebusy conflict check, deduplicated against `conflictCalendarIds`. Enforced on save in `PUT /api/booking/settings` and at the freebusy call site.
- `cancelBooking()` is idempotent: handles missing `googleEventId`, swallows GCal 404/410 with an INFO log, logs other failures at ERROR. MongoDB state is always updated regardless of GCal outcome.
- `rescheduleBooking(id, newStart, newEnd, triggeredBy)` supports `'admin'` (update GCal, email both) and `'coach_gcal'` (skip GCal update, email client only). `Booking.rescheduleHistory` records every change.
- Reminder cron filters `startTime >= now` at the Mongo layer and has a per-loop defensive guard.
- Google push-notification channels are registered via `registerGoogleWebhook(coachId)` after calendar select / settings save, stopped on disconnect, and renewed hourly when within 2 days of expiry. Notifications land on `POST /api/webhooks/gcal`; the handler validates `X-Goog-Channel-ID` / `X-Goog-Resource-ID` + the optional `X-Goog-Channel-Token` against `GOOGLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, then uses `calendar.events.list(updatedMin, showDeleted)` to diff changes. Activate with `BOOKING_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=true` after the Apache vhost proxies `/api/webhooks/gcal` to PM2.
- Full gap audit and implementation log in `docs/prompts/booking-sync-audit.md`.
- Integration tests at `backend/tests/behavior-*.test.ts` cover all 8 sync behaviors against a real in-memory MongoDB with googleapis/SES mocked. Run `npm test` from `/backend` (20 tests, ~40s).

## Booking ↔ Coaching Integration

Booking and CoachingSession are paired records when an internal coachee is involved:

- `Booking.coacheeId` / `Booking.engagementId` / `Booking.sessionId` link a Booking back into the coaching model
- `CoachingSession.bookingId` is the inverse pointer
- All cross-module logic lives in `backend/src/services/bookingCoachingSync.service.ts` to avoid circular imports

Flow rules:
- **Coachee books via public flow:** `POST /api/public/booking/:coachSlug` runs `optionalAuth`. When the booker is an authenticated coachee in the same org as the coach, `linkBookingToCoaching()` finds (or creates with `status='active'`) the CoachingEngagement and creates a paired CoachingSession with `status='scheduled'`. Anonymous bookings are unchanged.
- **Coach creates a Session:** `POST /api/coaching/sessions` mirrors the new session into a Booking via `mirrorSessionToBooking()`.
- **Cancel propagation:** `cancelBooking` → `propagateBookingCancel` sets the linked CoachingSession to `cancelled`. `DELETE /coaching/sessions/:id` → `propagateSessionDelete` cancels the linked Booking.
- **Reschedule propagation:** `rescheduleBooking` → `propagateBookingReschedule` updates the linked CoachingSession's `date` + `duration`. `PUT /coaching/sessions/:id` → `propagateSessionUpdate` mirrors date + completed/cancelled status to the linked Booking.
- **GCal ownership:** whichever side creates the record first owns the GCal event. The webhook diff path (B.2) finds the matching Booking by `googleEventId`, and propagation handles the paired CoachingSession from there.
- The public booking form pre-fills firstName/lastName/email from `AuthService.currentUser()` when the visitor is logged in.
